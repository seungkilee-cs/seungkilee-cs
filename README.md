My interests are: 


<details>
  <summary> Algorithmic Problem Solving </summary>
  
  Some people like Sudoku, some people like crossword puzzles. For me, algorithmic problems are like that. I think these show the process of my problem solving approach in general programming. Most of the time I just take notes on the submission and don't publish the solution, but the process is largely the same.

  Here are some leetcode solution showing not just the logic of the solution, but the system in which I approach a problem:
  - [2197. Replace Non-Coprime Numbers in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-non-coprime-numbers-in-array/solutions/7194687/euclid-algorithm-for-gcd-with-monotonic-slctq/)
  
  - [1935. Maximum Number of Words You Can Type](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-words-you-can-type/solutions/7190723/on-counter-solution-without-flags-by-lee-bz6m/)

  I also like investigating underneath the hood algorithms of how things:
  - [Image Compression by K Means Clustering](https://github.com/seungkilee-cs/K-Means-Image-Compression)  
  
  - [Fast Fourier Transform](https://github.com/seungkilee-cs/spektra/tree/master/rust-audio-processor)

<details>
  <summary> Philosophy </summary>
  
  I believe that philosophy, much like mathematics is a tool we can employee to solve a problem.  
  I'm Fascinated by Phenomenology and Modal Logic and I want to use the formal structure and concepts in Engineering to operationalize the narrative insights and achievements in humanities that haven't been streamlined.

<details>
<summary> Code </summary>
#### [Heidegger's Hermeneutic Circle Interpretation and Visualization]()
My biggest problem in understanding Heidegger was not merely difficulty in interpretating the text, but grasping the concept beyond the formal logic. Being and Time was difficult but very logical and streamlined, whereas the post-Kehre ideas in [What is Metaphysics]() was conceptually incompatible with the logical procedure of understanding. Only after I understood that Heidegger was disclosing a process rather than deriving it, was I able to understand the seemingly circular justifications.

#### [CWD Model of Desire]()
My critique from reading fo Deleuze's Rhizomatic Desire and the social constructionism it leads to, and my attempt to augment on it using graph theory concepts.

#### [Recursive Nature of Human Consciousness]()
Interpretation on Kierkegaard's "Life can only be reflected backward but lived forward" and Ricoeur's narrative explanation of Idem and Ipse identities operationalized with mutual recursion in Computer Science.

<summary> Writing </summary>

#### [Singular Other]()
My critique of Emmanuel Levinas and general principle of "broadening the circle." Establishing ethics as already and always fragmented, and the goal of macro system being not imposition of a grand standing but rather a defragmentation.

#### [Agnesification and Conceptual Bricolage]()
My thoguhts on how to build on someone's work not off of their authority, in contrasting methodology of conceptual adoptation in Stewart Hall - Gramsci/Lukacs vs Spivak - Gramsci.

#### [Seismicity of Idea]()
Examining Husserl's Problem Statement and 

#### [Ethical Descent - Transcending Problem of Intersubjectivity]()
My Critique of 

#### [Socio-Linguistic Symbolic Order]()
Explaining the mechanisms of how structural pre-conscious concepts manifest in m

#### [Power to Will - Foucauldian Inversion of ]()
Evaluation of Heidegger's Gestell vs Poiesis, and borrowing from directions that Foucault alludes to in order to explain the problem of fixed point analysis of Gestell vs Poiesis, and Will as Gestalt rather than collective of individual wills, and how power operates not as individual sway but rather as bending of the epistemic plane on which the wills manifest.

  <summary> Economics </summary>

  I started out as a Finance and Economics major in college, before I changed courses to engineering school for Computer Science degree. I liked Economics enough that I did finish the program and graduated with B.S. in both Computer Science and Economics. I did have to take over 150 credit hours and every interim semesters to do so. Was it worth it? I guess we won't know just yet.
  
### [Financial Modeling](https://www.seungkilee.com/Financial-Modeling/)

  Python is generally the go to tool for most people in finance and economics in visualizing the models used in Finances. However a lot of my friends back in college days knew of matplotlib but only knew how to copy paste from stackoverflow. The amount of times I had to help someone set up conda on their windows laptop for python was actually astounding.

  Of course, now with the LLMs it would be easy to adjust the models in visualization to however you want. But for those trying to understand the basis of the model and how variables interact with one another, would benefit from a real time visualization without having to install anything. I wished that something like this would exist back in college, and I think still a lot of people in school for economics and finances can benefit from simple and intuitive, interactive visualization tool without any set up overhead

### Data Science  
<details>
  Coming from the background of Computer Science and Economics, applied statistics was a natural intersection in the Venn Diagram of my interests and expertise. Starting with Machine Learning courses in college, I've been working on constructing models that more holistically explains the phenomena and more accurately predict the outcome.

  <summary> Audio </summary>
  
  I moved around a lot in my life so naturally my headphone collection is limited to a very small core devices like Focal Clear, Sennheiser HD800S, Hifiman HE6, Hifiman HE1000 V2. Naturally the Dac/Amps and sources are also largely consolidated. On the other hand, I have much more comprehensive collection of things more portable like IEMs and portable DACs. My interest in portable and local audio is what largely drives my audio related projects.

### [Spektra](https://www.seungkilee.com/spektra)
  
  Before I found Qobuz, there were some suspicious FLAC vendors online that had the lossless containers filled with ripped audio in 128kbps. While I had my suspicions of these cases, to make sure I used tools like [Spek](spek.cc) to verify that it had full range of audio signals. But installing spek on different machines was a little overhead, but an overhead nontheless. So I wanted to build a tool that can do what spek does but without any install and without any server side processing for privacy. Thus, Spektra is born. A spectrum analyzer hosted on static page, with RUST Core and JS Interface. This is my attempt at [Spek](spek.cc) for Web.

### [Saku Audio Player](https://www.seungkilee.com/saku-audio-player)
  
  Audio Player With AutoEq Supported 10 Band PEQ for IEM and Headphone
  
  I love using the PEQ functionality on PowerAmp on Android, and EqualizerAPO on windows. But again, with constant workspace switching, I needed something more ubiquitous. Qudelix 5K and the Chrome extension control does this very well, but it still requires me to carry a physical hardware and locks me into the specific hardware, plus the 2.5mm balanced output requires me to carry an adopter for 4.4mm cables. I wanted to build something that can give me the same abstraction of application specific PEQ control and AutoEq support that PowerAmp and Qudelix has, but serverless. And thus, Saku audio player is born. It also has some neat features like keyboard navigations and easy A/B testing feature using PEQ Bypass that I always wanted in other equalizers and audio players.

## What
As an engineer, I want to:   
- Mathematically interpretate our intuitions and accomplishments in the humanities yet to be operationalized and systemized.  
- Build Tools that scratches an itch.
- Build a model that more holistically explains and predicts the world.  
- Stack days upon days in hopes that it builds up to me someday.  
- Clearly and explicitly articulating myself in writing.  
- Bring value to people, whatever I do.
